plan:
- open/read csv w/ python/pandas (done)
- take 1% weighted sample (done)
- for each sample:
	get path/filename
	get timing info 
	write to individual file
	get COG, peak, slope, spread
	write to another file (?)
- interactive script
	in batches (to avoid opening 600 praat windows at once and crashing computer)
	subprocess call to praat script
	praat script opens corresponding file with path/filename and timing info (done)
		praat script adds a tier where annotation can happen (done)
	praat script opens textgrid and wav file, zooms in on time slice (done)
	praat script opens long term spectral slice window
	praat script opens info window with COG, peak, slope, spread measures
